# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

## Further improvements

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```
